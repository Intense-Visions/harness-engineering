feat(roadmap): dashboard conflict UX for file-less roadmap mode (Phase 7 — file-less GA blocker)

Closes the last file-less GA blocker by making HTTP 409 `TRACKER_CONFLICT` responses a first-class, accessible UX surface in the dashboard, and aligning the orchestrator's `roadmap-append` endpoint to emit the same conflict shape as the dashboard's claim endpoints (REV-P4-4, Option A).

**`@harness-engineering/dashboard`:**

- New `TrackerConflictBody` type, `isTrackerConflictBody` guard, and exported `CONFLICT_TOAST_TEMPLATE` constant in `src/shared/types.ts`.
- New Zustand `toastStore` (`src/client/stores/toastStore.ts`) with single-toast supersession via a monotonic `seq` counter so repeat conflicts always re-trigger the refresh effect.
- New `fetchWithConflict` helper (`src/client/utils/fetchWithConflict.ts`) returning a discriminated-union `{ ok: true, data } | { ok: false, status, conflict?, error? }` so every caller of an endpoint that can emit TRACKER_CONFLICT (S3, S5, S6) dispatches identically.
- New `scrollToFeatureRow` helper (`src/client/utils/scrollToFeatureRow.ts`): smooth-scrolls the contested row into the viewport, focuses it, and applies a 2-second `data-conflict-highlight` pulse-ring (degraded fallback when the row is no longer in the DOM).
- New `ConflictToastRegion` component (`src/client/components/ConflictToastRegion.tsx`) with `role="status"`, `aria-live="polite"`, `aria-atomic="true"`, and an explicit Dismiss button.
- `FeatureRow` now exposes `data-external-id="<externalId>"` and `tabIndex={-1}` on its root element so the conflict resolver can locate and focus the contested row without lifting refs.
- `ClaimConfirmation` recognizes the TRACKER_CONFLICT shape: dispatches a toast event, closes via `onCancel`, and never invokes `onConfirm` on conflict.
- `Analyze.tsx`'s "Add to roadmap" path is routed through a new `appendToRoadmap` helper that uses `fetchWithConflict`, so an S6 conflict surfaces via the same toast pathway.
- `Roadmap.tsx` mounts `ConflictToastRegion`, handles the refetch via `GET /api/roadmap` with `cache: 'no-store'`, dispatches the override into a `refreshedData` state, and drives the smooth-scroll-and-focus on the next animation frame; the manual override is cleared on the next SSE `lastUpdated` tick so live updates resume.
- CSS keyframes fallback for `data-conflict-highlight` ring animation in `index.css`.

**`@harness-engineering/orchestrator`:**

- `roadmap-append` (S6) now translates `ConflictError` from `client.create()` into HTTP `409 { error, code: 'TRACKER_CONFLICT', externalId, conflictedWith, refreshHint: 'reload-roadmap' }` (D-P7-A). Previously it emitted a generic 502. This closes REV-P4-4 by giving the dashboard a single uniform conflict shape across S3 (`/api/actions/roadmap/claim`), S5 (`/api/actions/roadmap-status`), and S6 (`/api/roadmap/append`).

**Documentation:**

- `docs/knowledge/dashboard/claim-workflow.md` gains a "Conflict UX" section describing the toast, auto-refetch, and scroll-to-row choreography for the file-less branch (step 4).

**Roadmap status:** With Phase 7 landed, the `tracker-only` roadmap (file-less mode) is feature-complete; manual browser verification of the toast, screen-reader announcement, focus, and pulse-ring is operator-side QA.
