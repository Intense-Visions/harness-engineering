# TanStack Query: Suspense Mode

> Use useSuspenseQuery to integrate React's Suspense and error boundaries with TanStack Query

## When to Use

- Building components that should suspend while data loads rather than rendering a loading state inline
- Integrating TanStack Query with React 18 concurrent features and streaming SSR
- Eliminating loading state conditionals (`if (isLoading) return <Spinner />`) from components
- Coordinating multiple loading states with a single parent Suspense boundary
- Using TanStack Query with Next.js App Router streaming

## Instructions

1. Use `useSuspenseQuery` instead of `useQuery` to opt into suspense mode — the component suspends instead of returning `isLoading`.
2. Wrap components using `useSuspenseQuery` in a `<Suspense fallback={...}>` boundary — without it, React throws an error.
3. Use `useSuspenseQueries` (plural) to run multiple suspense queries in parallel — suspends until all resolve.
4. Pair each `<Suspense>` with an error boundary (`<ErrorBoundary>` from `react-error-boundary`) to handle query errors.
5. Prefer `useSuspenseQuery` for data that is always needed — use regular `useQuery` for optional or conditional data.
6. For Next.js, prefetch data in Server Components and hydrate via `<HydrationBoundary>` — the Client Component suspends only if the cache is empty.

```typescript
// With useSuspenseQuery — no loading conditional needed
'use client';
import { useSuspenseQuery } from '@tanstack/react-query';
import { postDetailOptions } from '@/queries/posts';

// This component either renders with data or suspends — never shows partial state
function PostContent({ id }: { id: string }) {
  const { data: post } = useSuspenseQuery(postDetailOptions(id));
  // data is guaranteed to be defined here — TypeScript knows this
  return <article>{post.content}</article>;
}

// Wrapping component manages the Suspense/Error boundaries
import { Suspense } from 'react';
import { ErrorBoundary } from 'react-error-boundary';

function PostPage({ id }: { id: string }) {
  return (
    <ErrorBoundary fallback={<PostError />}>
      <Suspense fallback={<PostSkeleton />}>
        <PostContent id={id} />
      </Suspense>
    </ErrorBoundary>
  );
}

// Multiple parallel suspense queries — waits for all
import { useSuspenseQueries } from '@tanstack/react-query';

function PostWithRelated({ id }: { id: string }) {
  const [{ data: post }, { data: related }] = useSuspenseQueries({
    queries: [
      postDetailOptions(id),
      relatedPostsOptions(id),
    ],
  });
  // Both are defined — component suspends until both resolve
  return <PostLayout post={post} related={related} />;
}
```

## Details

`useSuspenseQuery` changes TanStack Query's data contract: instead of returning `{ data: T | undefined, isLoading, isError }`, it returns `{ data: T }` — data is always defined when the component renders. The component suspends (pauses rendering) until the data is available, and throws errors to the nearest error boundary.

**Type safety improvement:** With regular `useQuery`, `data` is typed as `T | undefined` — requiring null checks everywhere. With `useSuspenseQuery`, `data` is typed as `T` — no null checks needed because the component cannot render without data.

**Suspense boundary placement:** Multiple `useSuspenseQuery` calls in the same component all contribute to the same Suspense boundary. They suspend sequentially (each waits for the previous before starting) unless you use `useSuspenseQueries` which starts all fetches in parallel.

**Sequential vs parallel suspension:** Two `useSuspenseQuery` calls in one component create a waterfall — the second query does not start until the first resolves (because the component re-renders after each suspension). Use `useSuspenseQueries` to start all in parallel.

**Error handling:** `useSuspenseQuery` throws errors to the nearest React error boundary — unlike regular `useQuery` which catches errors internally and returns them as `{ isError, error }`. Always pair `<Suspense>` with an `<ErrorBoundary>` when using suspense mode.

**Next.js App Router:** Suspense queries work naturally with Next.js streaming — the `<Suspense>` boundary streams its fallback first, then streams the resolved content. Combined with server-side prefetching via `<HydrationBoundary>`, the component only suspends on cold cache misses.
