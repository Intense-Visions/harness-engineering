# @harness-engineering/cli

## 1.2.1

### Patch Changes

- dc88a2e: Codebase hardening: normalize package scripts, deduplicate Result type, tighten API surface, expand test coverage, and fix documentation drift.

  **Breaking (core):** Removed 6 internal helpers from the entropy barrel export: `resolveEntryPoints`, `parseDocumentationFile`, `findPossibleMatches`, `levenshteinDistance`, `buildReachabilityMap`, `checkConfigPattern`. These were implementation details not used by any downstream package. If you imported them directly from `@harness-engineering/core`, import from the specific detector file instead (e.g., `@harness-engineering/core/src/entropy/detectors/drift`).

  **core:** `Result<T,E>` is now re-exported from `@harness-engineering/types` instead of being defined separately. No consumer-facing change.

  **All packages:** Normalized scripts (consistent `test`, `test:watch`, `lint`, `typecheck`, `clean`). Added mcp-server to root tsconfig references.

  **mcp-server:** Fixed 5 `no-explicit-any` lint errors in architecture, feedback, and validate tools.

  **Test coverage:** Added 96 new tests across 13 new test files (types, cli subcommands, mcp-server tools).

  **Documentation:** Rewrote cli.md and configuration.md to match actual implementation. Fixed 10 inaccuracies in AGENTS.md.
