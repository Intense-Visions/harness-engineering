## 0.1.6

### Patch Changes

- ad48d91: Fix orchestrator state reconciliation, stale worktree reuse, and dashboard production proxy

  **@harness-engineering/orchestrator:**
  - Reconcile completed/claimed state against roadmap on each tick: completed entries are released after a grace period when they reappear as active candidates, and orphaned claims are released when escalated issues leave active candidates
  - Always recreate worktrees from latest base ref on dispatch instead of reusing stale worktrees from before an orchestrator restart
  - Add `analyses/`, `interactions/`, `workspaces/` to `.harness/.gitignore` template so orchestrator runtime directories are never committed

  **@harness-engineering/dashboard:**
  - Proxy orchestrator API and WebSocket in production mode (`harness dashboard run`), not just in Vite dev server — fixes dashboard failing to connect to orchestrator in production
  - Fix CORS to allow non-loopback HOST bindings

  **@harness-engineering/cli:**
  - Add `--orchestrator-url` flag to `harness dashboard` command for configuring the orchestrator proxy target
