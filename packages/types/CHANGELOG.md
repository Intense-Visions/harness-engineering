# @harness-engineering/types

## 0.9.1

### Patch Changes

- Reduce Tier 2 structural violations and fix exactOptionalPropertyTypes errors

## 0.9.0

### Minor Changes

- Add `title` field to `ExternalTicketState` interface for title-based dedup during push sync. Prevents duplicate GitHub issues when externalIds are missing from the roadmap.

## 0.8.0

### Minor Changes

- `TrackerSyncAdapter` interface extended with `getAuthenticatedUser()` method for retrieving the token owner's GitHub username. Enables auto-population of assignee fields during sync.

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- Roadmap sync, auto-pick, and assignment
  - **External tracker sync** — Bidirectional sync between roadmap.md and GitHub Issues via `TrackerSyncAdapter` interface. Split authority: roadmap owns planning fields, GitHub owns execution/assignment. Sync fires on every state transition (task-start, task-complete, phase-start, phase-complete, save-handoff, archive_session).
  - **Auto-pick pilot** — New `harness-roadmap-pilot` skill with AI-assisted next-item selection. Two-tier scoring: explicit priority first (P0-P3), then weighted position/dependents/affinity score. Routes to brainstorming (no spec) or autopilot (spec exists).
  - **Assignment with affinity** — Assignee, Priority, and External-ID fields on roadmap features. Assignment history section in roadmap.md enables affinity-based routing. Reassignment produces audit trail (unassigned + assigned records).
  - **New types** — `Priority`, `AssignmentRecord`, `ExternalTicket`, `ExternalTicketState`, `SyncResult`, `TrackerSyncConfig` in @harness-engineering/types.
  - **Config schema** — `TrackerConfigSchema` and `RoadmapConfigSchema` added to `HarnessConfigSchema` for validated tracker configuration.

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- Multi-platform MCP expansion, security hardening, and release readiness fixes

  **@harness-engineering/cli (minor):**
  - Multi-platform MCP support: add Codex CLI and Cursor to `harness setup-mcp`, `harness setup`, and slash command generation
  - Cursor tool picker with `--pick` and `--yes` flags using `@clack/prompts` for interactive tool selection
  - TOML MCP entry writer for Codex `.codex/config.toml` integration
  - Sentinel prompt injection defense hooks (`sentinel-pre`, `sentinel-post`) added to hook profiles
  - `--tools` variadic option for `harness mcp` command
  - Fix lint errors in hooks (no-misleading-character-class, unused imports, `any` types)
  - Fix cost-tracker hook field naming (snake_case → camelCase alignment)
  - Fix test gaps: doctor MCP mock, usage fetch mock, profiles/integration hook counts

  **@harness-engineering/core (minor):**
  - Usage module: Claude Code JSONL parser (`parseCCRecords`), daily and session aggregation
  - Security scanner: session-scoped taint state management, `SEC-DEF-*` insecure-defaults rules, `SEC-EDGE-*` sharp-edges rules
  - Security: false-positive verification gate replacing suppression checks, `parseHarnessIgnore` helper
  - Fix lint: eslint-disable for intentional zero-width character regex in injection patterns

  **@harness-engineering/types (minor):**
  - Add `DailyUsage`, `SessionUsage`, `UsageRecord`, and `ModelPricing` types for cost tracking
  - Export aggregate types from types barrel

  **@harness-engineering/orchestrator (patch):**
  - Integrate sentinel config scanning into dispatch pipeline
  - Fix conditional spread for optional line property

## 0.5.0

### Patch Changes

- No public API changes — version bump to align with downstream consumers

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- **Session-scoped accumulative state types** — New types for session section state management: `SessionSection`, `SessionSectionEntry`, `SessionSectionStatus`, and related interfaces. Re-exported from package index.

## 0.3.1

### Patch Changes

- Add optional `created` and `updated` fields to `RoadmapFrontmatter` interface for roundtrip preservation

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- # Orchestrator Release & Workspace Hardening

  ## New Features
  - **Orchestrator Daemon**: Implemented a long-lived daemon for autonomous agent lifecycle management.
    - Pure state machine core for deterministic dispatch and reconciliation.
    - Multi-tracker support (Roadmap adapter implemented).
    - Isolated per-issue workspaces with deterministic path resolution.
    - Ink-based TUI and HTTP API for real-time observability.
  - **Harness Docs Pipeline**: Sequential pipeline for documentation health (drift detection, coverage audit, and auto-alignment).

  ## Improvements
  - **Documentation Coverage**: Increased project-wide documentation coverage to **84%**.
    - Comprehensive JSDoc/TSDoc for core APIs.
    - New Orchestrator Guide and API Reference.
    - Unified Source Map reference for all packages.
  - **Workspace Stability**: Resolved all pending lint errors and type mismatches in core packages.
  - **Graceful Shutdown**: Added signal handling and centralized resource cleanup for the orchestrator daemon.
  - **Hardened Security**: Restricted orchestrator HTTP API to localhost.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- Add Roadmap, Milestone, Feature, and FeatureStatus types for project roadmap management

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- Add CI/CD integration commands and documentation
  - New `harness ci check` command: runs all harness checks (validate, deps, docs, entropy, phase-gate) with structured JSON output and meaningful exit codes
  - New `harness ci init` command: generates CI config for GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or a generic shell script
  - New CI types: `CICheckReport`, `CICheckName`, `CIPlatform`, and related interfaces
  - Core `runCIChecks` orchestrator composing existing validation into a single CI entrypoint
  - 4 documentation guides: automation overview, CI/CD validation, issue tracker integration, headless agents
  - 6 copy-paste recipes: GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, shell script, webhook handler, Jira rules, headless agent action

## 0.0.1

### Patch Changes

- dc88a2e: Codebase hardening: normalize package scripts, deduplicate Result type, tighten API surface, expand test coverage, and fix documentation drift.

  **Breaking (core):** Removed 6 internal helpers from the entropy barrel export: `resolveEntryPoints`, `parseDocumentationFile`, `findPossibleMatches`, `levenshteinDistance`, `buildReachabilityMap`, `checkConfigPattern`. These were implementation details not used by any downstream package. If you imported them directly from `@harness-engineering/core`, import from the specific detector file instead (e.g., `@harness-engineering/core/src/entropy/detectors/drift`).

  **core:** `Result<T,E>` is now re-exported from `@harness-engineering/types` instead of being defined separately. No consumer-facing change.

  **All packages:** Normalized scripts (consistent `test`, `test:watch`, `lint`, `typecheck`, `clean`). Added mcp-server to root tsconfig references.

  **mcp-server:** Fixed 5 `no-explicit-any` lint errors in architecture, feedback, and validate tools.

  **Test coverage:** Added 96 new tests across 13 new test files (types, cli subcommands, mcp-server tools).

  **Documentation:** Rewrote cli.md and configuration.md to match actual implementation. Fixed 10 inaccuracies in AGENTS.md.
